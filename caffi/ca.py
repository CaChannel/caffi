"""
The is the low level access to EPICS channel access library. It maps the corresponding C API to Python functions.
Even though as same as possible, there are subtle differences:

  - The `ca_` prefix of the C function name has been removed, e.g. C function `ca_create_channel` is now
    Python function :func:`create_channel`.

  - The C function `ca_context_destroy` has been renamed to :func:`destroy_context` to have the same symmetry
    as *XXX*\_context.

  - The two separate C functions `ca_client_status` and `ca_context_status` have been merged into :func:`show_context`.
    Internally it calls the appropriate C function depending on whether *context* is given.

  - The order of the argument might have been altered to allow default arguments, thus more pythonic.
    Take C function `array_put_callback` for example,
    ::

        int ca_array_put_callback
        (
            chtype                 type,
            unsigned long          count,
            chid                   chanId,
            const void *           pValue,
            caEventCallBackFunc *  pFunc,
            void *                 pArg
        );

    Its Python counterpart,
    ::

        put(chid, value, chtype=None, count=None, callback=None)

    Only two arguments are mandatory, which are the channel identifier and the value to write.
    The others are made optional and have reasonable defaults.

  - In C API the callback function handler has the following signature,
    ::

        void (*)(struct xxx_handler_args)

    In Python counterpart, the callback signature is
    ::

        def callback(epicsArgs):

    *epicsArgs* is a dict converted from `xxx_handler_args`.

  - C functions normally return status code to indicate success or failure. The Python counterparts follow
    this but have exceptions:

    - The get functions in C require a user supplied memory pointer passed as argument. In Python the function
      :func:`get` and :func:`sg_get` returns a tuple of form (:class:`ECA`, :class:`DBRValue`)

      The first item is the status code, which must be :data:`ECA.NORMAL`, before using the second item.

      The second item holds the reference to the allocated memory. And the memory is not stable until a subsequent
      call of :func:`pend_io` returns :data:`ECA.NORMAL`. Then the value can be retrieved by calling
      :meth:`DBRValue.get`.


    - All the creation functions, :func:`create_channel`, :func:`create_subscription` and :func:`sg_create`
      return a tuple of the form (:class:`ECA`, *object identifier*).
      The object identifier can only be used if the first item is :data:`ECA.NORMAL`.

  - In C the following macros definition are also accessible as :class:`enum.IntEnum` type:

    ======================  ============
    C Macros                Python Enum
    ======================  ============
    *ECA_XXX*               :class:`ECA`
    *DBE_XXX*               :class:`DBE`
    *DBF_XXX*               :class:`DBF`
    *DBR_XXX*               :class:`DBR`
    *CA_OP_XXX*             :class:`CA_OP`
    *cs_xxx*                :class:`ChannelState`
    *XXX_ALARM* (severity)  :class:`AlarmSeverity`
    *XXX_ALARM* (status)    :class:`AlarmCondition`
    ======================  ============

    This makes it convenient when interactively examine the code value. e.g.
    ::

        >>> ca.create_context(True)
        <ECA.NORMAL: 1>
        >>> status, chid = ca.create_channel('catest')
        >>> ca.pend_io(2)
        <ECA.NORMAL: 1>
        >>> ca.name(chid)
        'catest'
        >>> ca.host_name(chid)
        'localhost:5064'
        >>> ca.field_type(chid)
        <DBF.DOUBLE: 6>
        >>> ca.element_count(chid)
        1
        >>> ca.read_access(chid)
        True
        >>> ca.write_access(chid)
        True
        >>> ca.put(chid, 10)
        <ECA.NORMAL: 1>
        >>> ca.flush_io()
        <ECA.NORMAL: 1>
        >>> status, dbrvalue = ca.get(chid)
        >>> ca.pend_io(2)
        <ECA.NORMAL: 1>
        >>> dbrvalue.get()
        10.0

                        but this might change in the future.
                        The abstract priority range specified is mapped into an operating system specific

                        that does not have native support for prioritized delivery or execution respectively.
                        Specifying many different priorities within the same program can increase resource consumption
                        in the client and the server because an independent virtual circuit, and associated
                        data structures, is created for each priority that is used on a particular server.

                        - :data:`ECA.ALLOCMEM` - Unable to allocate memory

    The CA client library will attempt to establish and maintain a virtual circuit between the caller's application
    and a named process variable in a CA server. Each call to ca_create_channel allocates resources
    in the CA client library and potentially also a CA server.
    The function :func:`clear_channel` is used to release these resources.

    If successful, the routine returns a channel identifier. This identifier can be used with any channel access call
    that operates on a channel.

    The circuit may be initially connected or disconnected depending on the state of the network
    and the location of the channel. A channel will only enter a connected state
    after the server's address is determined, and only if channel access successfully establishes a virtual circuit
    through the network to the server. Channel access routines that send a request to a server
    will return :data:`ECA.DISCONNCHID` if the channel is currently disconnected.

    There are two ways to obtain asynchronous notification when a channel enters a connected state.

    - The first and simplest method requires that you call ca_pend_io(), and wait for successful completion,
      prior to using a channel that was created without specifying call back function.

    - The second method requires that you register a connection handler
      by supplying a valid connection callback function pointer. This connection handler is called whenever
      the connection state of the channel changes. If you have installed a connection handler
      then :func:`pend_io` will not block waiting for the channel to enter a connected state.

    The function :func:`state` can be used to test the connection state of a channel.
    Valid connections may be isolated from invalid ones with this function :func:`pend_io` times out.

    Due to the inherently transient nature of network connections the order of connection call backs
    relative to the order that :func:`create_channel` calls are made by the application
    can't be guaranteed, and application programs may need to be prepared for a connected channel to
    enter a disconnected state at any time.

    :param float timeout: Specifies the time out interval. A timeout interval of zero specifies forever.
    :return:
        - :data:`ECA.NORMAL` - Normal successful completion
        - :data:`ECA.TIMEOUT` - Selected IO requests didn't complete before specified timeout
        - :data:`ECA.EVDISALLOW` - Function inappropriate for use within an event handler

    If :data:`ECA.NORMAL` is returned then it can be safely assumed that
    all outstanding get requests *without* callback have completed successfully and
    channels created *without* callback have connected for the first time.

    If :data:`ECA.TIMEOUT` is returned then it must be assumed for all previous get requests and
    properly qualified first time channel connects have failed.

    If :data:`ECA.TIMEOUT` is returned then get requests may be reissued
    followed by a subsequent call to :func:`pend_io`.
    Specifically, the function will block only for outstanding get requests issued,
    and also any channels created *without* callback,
    after the last call to ca_pend_io() or ca client context creation whichever is later.
    Note that :func:`create_channel` requests generally should not be reissued for the same process variable
    unless :func:`clear_channel` is called first.

    If no get or connection state change events are outstanding then :func:`pend_io` will flush the send buffer and
    return immediately without processing any outstanding channel access background activities.

    The delay specified should take into account worst case network delays
    such as Ethernet collision exponential back off until retransmission delays
    which can be quite long on overloaded networks.

    Unlike :func:`pend_event`, this routine will not process CA's background activities
    if none of the selected IO requests are pending.
