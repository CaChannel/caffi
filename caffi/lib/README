This folder includes the EPICS base dynamic libraries built under host arch, linux-x86, linux-x86_64, win32-x86, windows-x64, darwin-x86.

Build Notes:
1. On Scientific Linux 6, EPICS is built without readline support
        configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.linux-x86
        configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.linux-x86_64
   and without SHRLIB_VERSION
        configure/CONFIG_BASE
   Change the RPATH
        $ chrpath -r '${ORIGIN}' libca.so
2. On Windows, EPICS calling convention changes from __stdcall to __cdecl (shareLib.h).
3. On macOS, the libraries include both 32 and 64-bit architecture
        configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.darwin-x86
   and change library name and rpath
        $ chmod +w libca.dylib libCom.dylib
        $ install_name_tool -id libCom.dylib libCom.dylib
        $ install_name_tool -id libca.dylib libca.dylib
        $ otool -L libca.dylib # to display libCom.dylib path
        $ install_name_tool -change /Users/wang/epics/base-3.14.12.5/lib/darwin-x86/libCom.3.14.12.dylib @loader_path/libCom.dylib libca.dylib
        $ chmod -w libca.dylib libCom.dylib
